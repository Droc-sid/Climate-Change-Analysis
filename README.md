# Climate-Change-Analysis
Quantiative Time Series Analysis And Stochastic Modeling of Climate Change Effects in Selected Kenyan Counties.


# Overview 
This capstone project explores the effects of climate change across four counties in Kenya. 
1.Nairobi
2.Kajiado
3.Machakos
4.Makueni
Using the Quantitative methods Time Series Forecasting and Machine Learning Models.
The aim is to forecast future climate conditions and intergrate coursework from multiple academic units.

#Objectives

-Analyze historical and current climate data
-Model climate variables using stochastic process and time series forecasting 
-Build a machine learning model to prediict climate indicators with over 85% accurracy 
-Apply OPerations Research to optimize resource allocation 
-Use a NoSQL database (MongDB) for data management
-Intergrate basic information systems audit techniques for data integrity and traceability
